This project is part of an on going research in fake news detection.

This script extracts data obtained by a twitter API and updates 992 JSON files with details of each tweet, checks if the data contains a URL, weather the tweet is verified or has corrections, and finally if any corrections or verifications were made to the tweet the JSON file is labeled as conflicted.
